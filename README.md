# Emerging Technologies Assessment

This repository contains coursework for the *Emerging Technologies* module.
The project explores the differences between classical and quantum algorithms
through the Deutsch and Deutsch–Jozsa problems.

The implementation is presented as a Jupyter notebook and is structured to
demonstrate problem-solving, theoretical understanding and clean software
engineering practices suitable for an informed computing audience.
